### **2.3 The Architecture of the Network**

  - Then, discuss each model (EfficientNet and UNet) separately.


The authors mainly take network capacity, datasets size, image resoultion and computation resources into consideration for the design of the networks.

For StreetSurfaceVis dataset containing 9122 images, the network is backbone by a pretrained EfficientNet-B0, a lightweight yet powerful model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, it's of flexibility to handle high-resolution images in the scenario of 1024x1024, combining downsampling laterly to suit for the computational hardware. The addition of attention modules could enhance the network's ability to focus on fine-grained, road surface relevant features for classification. 

For mapillary dataset, which is more diverser and larger than the former...






#### **2.3.1 EfficientNet for Road Surface Classification**
- **Improvement**: Clarify the technical details. For example:
  - Explain why EfficientNet-B4 was chosen (e.g., trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency).
  - Describe the attention mechanisms (channel and spatial) in more detail, including their mathematical formulation or visual representation.
  - Discuss how global average pooling, batch normalization, and dropout improve model performance.


Road Surface Classifier is backbone by pretrained EfficientNet-B0'features block, replacing the final classifcation layer with a new linear layer, which has five output features, namly five classes of road surface in the dataset, asphalt, paving stones, concrete, sett and unpaved.

StreetSurfaceVis dataset's labels are applied for the whole street-view image rather than the roads solely. Given that, the authors have applied attention machanisms after extracting features ---channnel attention, encouraging the model to learn the distinct road surface features, such as texture, color, edges; spatial attention, focusing on pixels where  road locate on. Thus, channel attention is applied to the final feature map and spatial attention afterwards.

Before passing feature maps through the final classification layer, the authors have performed global average pooling for dimensions reduction and added regularization techniques, such as batch normalization and dropout layer, preventing model from overfitting.





#### **2.3.2 UNet with Attention for Road Segmentation**
- **Improvement**: Add details about the UNet architecture. For example:
  - Why UNet was chosen (e.g., its effectiveness in segmentation tasks).
  - How attention mechanisms are integrated into UNet.
  - Comparison with EfficientNet in terms of performance and computational requirements.

Why U-Net Works Well for Segmentation
Precise Localization: The skip connections enable the network to combine high-level context with fine-grained details, making it ideal for tasks requiring precise boundaries (e.g., road segmentation).

Efficiency: U-Net is relatively lightweight compared to other segmentation models like DeepLab or PSPNet, making it faster to train and deploy.

Flexibility: It can be adapted to various segmentation tasks by modifying the number of layers, channels, or loss functions.


Key Features of U-Net
Skip Connections:

Skip connections between the encoder and decoder are the most critical feature of U-Net.

They allow the decoder to access high-resolution features from the encoder, enabling precise localization of objects (e.g., roads).

Without skip connections, the decoder would lose fine-grained details due to the downsampling in the encoder.

Fully Convolutional:

U-Net is a fully convolutional network (FCN), meaning it does not use fully connected layers.

This makes it highly efficient and capable of handling input images of arbitrary sizes.

End-to-End Training:

U-Net is trained end-to-end using pixel-wise loss functions like cross-entropy loss or Dice loss.

The loss is computed between the predicted segmentation map and the ground truth mask.



Why Segmenting the Major Road is Easier:
Simplicity: The major road is often the largest and most visible object in the image, making it easier for the model to learn its features.

Less Ambiguity: There is usually less ambiguity in defining the major road compared to smaller roads or lanes.

Fewer Classes: Segmenting only the major road reduces the problem to binary segmentation (road vs. non-road), whereas segmenting all roads requires multi-class segmentation.


If Your Goal is Ego-Road Segmentation:

Focus on segmenting the major road (ego-road) using a standard U-Net or Attention U-Net.

This task is simpler and more likely to yield good results within a limited training time (e.g., 48 hours).


Attention U-Net:

If you choose to implement Attention U-Net, it will likely improve performance for ego-road segmentation by focusing on the most relevant regions.

Attention U-Net can be meaningful for road segmentation on Mapillary Vistas, especially for ego-road segmentation or handling complex scenes.

Segmenting the major road is easier than segmenting all roads because it involves fewer classes, less ambiguity, and simpler features.
